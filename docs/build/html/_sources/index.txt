Heroes Academy: Introduction to AI, Winter 2016
===============================================

Course Description
=====================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all around us, from web search to video games. AI methods plan driving directions, filter spam, focus cameras, recognizes speech, and translates languages. Beyond today's applications, AI is at the core of many emerging technologies like self-driving cars, household robots, and virtual humans. In the years to come, Artificial Intelligence will help transform science fiction into reality.

In this 10-week course, we will cover basic ideas and techniques underlying Artificial Intelligence using Python. Primarily, the course will use the programming of adversarial video games (such as tic-tac-toe, chess, and robowars) to illustrate core concepts. We will go through the importance of representations, which will introduce graph theory and probability theory. We will also cover the difficulty of rational decisions: evaluating the value of actions in context and choosing actions when there are too many options. By the end of the course, students will have a structured view of intelligent agents and their function.
