Week 4: Adversarial Search, Part 1
==================================


Summary
-------

We covered the beginning of adversarial search.  Because of the snow week, however, we didn't dive too deeply into it.  We did discuss breadth-first search vs depth-first and the merits of each.  We also looked a little bit at minimax.

Homework
--------

Project 1
^^^^^^^^^

Minimax.
""""""""

There is skeleton code for agents and the tic-tac-toe game at `my AI-Games repository <https://github.com/braingineer/AI-games>`_.  In addition to the slides below, there are many blog posts which describe the minimax algorithm very well. I have linked to several below.  It is not a difficult concept, but it can be a tricky implementation.  It requires some thinking about recursive function calls.

**Important**: You should use these resources to inform you on how to create a minimax agent.  Since you are turning in your code for evaluation, copying will be detected.  Also, copying will not work with the Tic-Tac-Toe framework I've provided.

After you get it working, I will mark up your code with comments on coding style, possible issues, and ways to make it better.  We will go over these next week.
