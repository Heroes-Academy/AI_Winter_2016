Installing Python
=================

Python Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to get Python.
You should have a flash drive with an installer.
In case you don't, I recommend the `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution.
It has a bunch of things packaged with it above and beyond Python that make it useful.



An Editor
^^^^^^^^^

There are many good editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
I personally prefer editors, which are more minimalistic.
However, for beginners, I would highly recommend `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_.
If you download PyCharm, make sure you download the Community Edition.

Other than PyCharm, `Sublime Text <https://sublimetext.com/>`_ is very good and what I use.
Then, Github has their own editor that is very comparable to Sublime.  It is called `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_.
