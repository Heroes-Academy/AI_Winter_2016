Week 2: Trees and Problem Solving
=================================


Summary
^^^^^^^

This week we covered the basics of trees, well defined problems, and well defined solutions.  We discussed what it meant to search through a tree for problem solving.  We discussed this in the context of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. 


Homework
^^^^^^^^

Complete the `Missionaries and Cannibals skeleton code <https://github.com/Heroes-Academy/AI_Winter_2016/blob/master/code/mc.py>`_ so that it solves the problem.  There should be 4 solutions.  If you'd like to push further and explore more problems like this, you can also try the `Towers of Hanoi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi>`_, the `8-Puzzle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle>`_, or the `8-Queens problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle>`_. 

See the lectures slides or email me if you get stuck.
