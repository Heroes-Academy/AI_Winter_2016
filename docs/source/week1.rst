Week 1: State Representations
=============================


iPython Notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In class, we discussed Finite State Automata.  You can find my `bunny FSA`_ online.


Homework
^^^^^^^^

Model, as an FSA, some object, person, animal, or thing.
It can be the FSA you started in class.
It should be simple enough that it can see a sequence of simple percepts and
it will transition between states.
The goal is to think only about how states can be related to each other.


Lecture Slides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
