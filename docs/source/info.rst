What are the expectations of this course?
-----------------------------------------
I expect that...

1. You will ask questions when you do not get something.
2. You will keep up with the work.
3. You will fail fast:
  - Failing is good
  - We learn when we fail
  - We only find bugs when code fails; we rarely hunt for bugs when code is working
4. You will not copy and paste code from the internet
  - You are only cheating yourself.
  - It won't bother me if you do it, but you will not learn the material.
5. You will try the homework at least once and email me with solutions or questions by Wednesday
