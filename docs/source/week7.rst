Week 7: Navigation, Part 2
==========================

Summary
-------

Last week, we derived the A* algorithm and implemented it in class.
This week, we will work towards combining it with Minimax to give us an
algorithm that will find best paths while avoiding others.

We will either code this algorithm into the Worm Wars game or the Pacman game from Berkeley's AI materials.

Homework
--------

Add some functionality to our code; this is contingent on how the class goes.

Resources
---------

To be determined.

Slides
------

Will be posted after the class.
